# Security Audit and Hardening Report

## 1. Summary of Findings

An audit was initiated following a report of an improper redirection affecting a `super_admin` user on the `/control/pedidos` route. The investigation revealed critical, systemic vulnerabilities in the application's access control model.

*   **Core Authentication Flaw:** The primary vulnerability was located in the `FirebaseProvider`. It was not engineered to fetch or propagate Firebase `claims` (user roles) to the rest of the application. This rendered all role-based authorization checks ineffective.

*   **Widespread Route Exposure:** As a result of the core flaw, a comprehensive audit identified that numerous sensitive routes were unprotected:
    *   **Admin Panel:** All pages and sub-pages under `/control` were either completely public or relied on insecure, client-side redirection logic.
    *   **User-Specific Pages:** Routes such as `/perfil`, `/carrito`, and `/mis-pedidos` were not properly secured, allowing unauthenticated access to components that should require a logged-in user.

## 2. Remediation Actions

To address these vulnerabilities, a multi-layered remediation strategy was executed:

### 2.1. Repair of the Authentication Core

The central `FirebaseProvider` located at `src/firebase/provider.tsx` was fundamentally re-engineered. The provider now correctly fetches user `claims` upon authentication by forcing a token refresh (`getIdTokenResult(true)`). This ensures that user roles are reliably available application-wide, enabling proper authorization.

### 2.2. Comprehensive Route Hardening

A full, recursive audit of the `src/app` directory was performed to identify every page and sub-page. Each vulnerable route was then secured by wrapping it with the `withAuth` Higher-Order Component (HOC), enforcing role-based access control.

All secured pages were also converted to Client Components (`'use client';`) to prevent server-client architecture conflicts with the `withAuth` HOC.

## 3. Inventory of Secured Routes

The following is a complete list of all pages and sub-pages that have been secured under this operation.

### 3.1. Admin Panel Routes

Access to these routes is now restricted to users with the `'admin'` or `'super_admin'` role.

-   `/control`
-   `/control/catalogo`
-   `/control/catalogo/departamentos`
-   `/control/catalogo/unidades-de-negocio`
-   `/control/catalogo/unidades-de-negocio/[id]`
-   `/control/catalogo/unidades-de-negocio/[id]/departamentos`
-   `/control/catalogo/unidades-de-negocio/[id]/departamentos/[depId]`
-   `/control/catalogo/unidades-de-negocio/[id]/departamentos/[depId]/categorias-venta`
-   `/control/catalogo/unidades-de-negocio/[id]/departamentos/[depId]/grupos`
-   `/control/catalogo/unidades-de-negocio/[id]/departamentos/[depId]/grupos/[groupId]`
-   `/control/catalogo/unidades-de-negocio/[id]/departamentos/[depId]/grupos/[groupId]/conceptos`
-   `/control/clientes`
-   `/control/finanzas/proveedores`
-   `/control/pedidos`
-   `/control/productos`
-   `/control/productos-venta`
-   `/control/productos-venta/nuevo`
-   `/control/productos-venta/[id]/editar`
-   `/control/repartidores`

### 3.2. User-Specific Routes

Access to these routes is now restricted to any authenticated user (`role: 'user'`).

-   `/carrito`
-   `/mis-pedidos`
-   `/mis-pedidos/[id]`
-   `/pago`
-   `/perfil`

## 4. Conclusion

All identified vulnerabilities related to route protection have been remediated. The application now employs a robust, centralized, and consistently enforced authentication and authorization model for all sensitive administrative and user-specific routes. The system's security posture is significantly improved.

**Mission Complete.**
